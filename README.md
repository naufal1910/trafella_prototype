## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Structure

Trafella is a single-script Streamlit application with a clear and modular structure.

- **`trafella.py`**: The main and only script, which contains all the application logic.
  - **UI:** The user interface is built entirely with Streamlit.
  - **Flight Search:** It uses the `google-search-results` library to query the SerpAPI Google Flights endpoint.
  - **AI Agents:** It leverages the `agno` library to create three specialized AI agents (`Researcher`, `Planner`, `Hotel & Restaurant Finder`), all powered by the Gemini model.
  - **Translation:** It uses the `transformers` library with a `Helsinki-NLP` model for local translation.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies.
- **`LICENSE`**: The project is licensed under the MIT License.
